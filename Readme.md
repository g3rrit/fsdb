# File System Database (FSDB)

The *File System Database* is a small library written in C that can be used as a simple database in the **only** sense
of offering a way to persistently store data.
The data is stored in the filesystem either at `$HOME/.fsdb` or `$FSDB_ROOT` if the environment variable
`$FSDB_ROOT` is set.
It provides two functions: `store` and `load` which use and identifier to store or load data from the filesystem.
Both functions will block if the file associated with an identifier is currently read or written to.

Data can only be deleted manually by removing the file associated with an identifier.

This database is extremely slow compared to *any* other database system and really just a toy project that
satisfies a very specific use case.
